wr-template
===========

This layer provides template processing support to OpenEmbedded.  Wind River
templates are a mechanism that permit various configurations to be enabled
with a simple setting.


What is a template?
-------------------
A template lives in the 'templates' directory of a given layer.  The templates
directory contains a series of directories to organize the templates.  The name
of the directory is used to enable the template.  The 'default' directory will
cause that template to be included by default even if the user has not
specified it.

A template directory may contain:
   README - template README file
   require - list of other templates required for this one
   template.conf - template configuration fragment
   image.inc - image fragment
   bsp-pkgs.conf - BSP specific configuration fragment
   bsp-pkgs.inc - BSP specific image fragment

The README file is simply plain text that will be copied to a generated
README_templates file in the users TOPDIR.  This allows a user to see
all README information for each template they have selected.

The require file may include comments, starting with a '#' or template names
to include.

The template.conf file contains various configuration variables that would
normally be placed into local.conf (or another similar.conf file) by the user.

The image.inc file contains various image recipe specific variables.  The
variables here are typically added to a recipe (.bb) or bbappend file.

The bsp-pkgs.conf and bsp-pkgs.inc files are only loaded if the user is
compiling a BSP that is defined in that layer.  The bsp-pkgs.conf is equivalent
to the template.conf file, while the bsp-pkgs.inc is equivalent to the
image.inc file.

In addition, the layer allows for the templates to set various banner
messages.

    CONFIG_BANNER[path_to_template] = "..."
    BANNER[path_to_template] = "..."

A configuration banner is only displayed if bitbake has to reparse the
configuration.  A runtime banner will always be displayed each time a 
build is run.
