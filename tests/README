This is simply a test layer for use by the wr-template layer.

The following lists the various tests assisted by this layer

Banners:

In your local.conf file add:

CONFIG_BANNER[banner] = "This is a test of the CONFIG_BANNER"
BANNER[banner] = "This is a test of the runtime banner"

bitbake -c fetch bash

You should see both banners displayed.

bitbake -c fetch bash

You should only see the runtime banner displayed.


Banner w/ template:

In your local.conf file (clear the previous test, then) add:

WRTEMPLATES = "feature/banner"
